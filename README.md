## Level Up
Level up is a Rails app that enables users to focus on particular skills that they want to study. This is achieved by a user interface that helps visualize their progress, as well as a task manager that helps users organize their study sessions efficiently. If users are not sure how to proceed in their studies, they can look at what other users have been doing to improve the skill in question. Upon achieving self-set milestones, users are rewarded by "leveling up" their skills and receiving badges to commemorate their accomplishments. The merit gem was thorougly used to implement these reward-based functions.
